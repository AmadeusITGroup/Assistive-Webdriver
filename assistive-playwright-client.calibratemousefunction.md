## CalibrateMouseFunction type

A mouse calibration function. This is returned by [createVM()](./assistive-playwright-client.createvm.md) in the [VMWithPlaywright](./assistive-playwright-client.vmwithplaywright.md) object. The [calibration process](./assistive-playwright-client.playwrightcalibrate.md) finds where the browser viewport is located on the screen, allowing to use coordinates relative to the viewport or to a DOM element instead of using screen coordinates. This function returns a [VMMouse](./assistive-playwright-client.vmmouse.md) object that allows to easily send low-level mouse events to the virtual machine.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type CalibrateMouseFunction = (frame: Page | Frame, options?: CalibrationOptions) => Promise<VMMouse>;
```
<b>References:</b> [CalibrationOptions](./assistive-playwright-client.calibrationoptions.md)<!-- -->, [VMMouse](./assistive-playwright-client.vmmouse.md)
