## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [clearMessages()](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.clearmessages.md) |  | Empties the [messages](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.messages.md) array and returns its previous content. |
|  [create(url)](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.create.md) | <code>static</code> | Connects to a websocket url and returns a corresponding instance of [ScreenReaderClient](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.md) as soon as it is connected. |
|  [disconnect()](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.disconnect.md) |  | Disconnects the underlying websocket, thus preventing any further message from being received. |
|  [off(event, listener)](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.off.md) |  | Unregisters a listener for the given event. |
|  [on(event, listener)](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.on.md) |  | Registers a listener for the <code>message</code> event, that will be called each time a message is received from the screen reader. |
|  [on(event, listener)](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.on_1.md) |  | Registers a listener for the <code>error</code> event, that will be called if an error happens in the connection with the screen reader. |
|  [on(event, listener)](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.on_2.md) |  | Registers a listener for the <code>close</code> event, that will be called when the connection to the screen reader is closed |
|  [once(event, listener)](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.once.md) |  | Registers a one-time listener for the <code>message</code> event, that will be called the next time a message is received from the screen reader. |
|  [once(event, listener)](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.once_1.md) |  | Registers a one-time listener for the <code>error</code> event, that will be called if an error happens in the connection with the screen reader. |
|  [once(event, listener)](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.once_2.md) |  | Registers a one-time listener for the <code>close</code> event, that will be called when the connection to the screen reader is closed |
|  [waitForMessage(expectedText, options)](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.waitformessage.md) |  | Waits for a specific message from the screen reader. |
|  [waitForMessageCondition(condition, options)](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.waitformessagecondition.md) |  | Execute the <code>condition</code> function on each received message until it returns a truthy value or the specified timeout occurs. If there is a timeout, the promise returned by this function is rejected. |
