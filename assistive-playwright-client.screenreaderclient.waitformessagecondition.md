## ScreenReaderClient.waitForMessageCondition() method

Execute the `condition` function on each received message until it returns a truthy value or the specified timeout occurs. If there is a timeout, the promise returned by this function is rejected.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
waitForMessageCondition<T>(condition: (value: string, index: number, messages: string[]) => T | undefined, options?: {
        includeCurrent?: boolean;
        timeout?: number;
    }): Promise<T>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  condition | (value: string, index: number, messages: string\[\]) =&gt; T \| undefined | function that is called for each message as long as it returns a falsy value. When it returns a truthy value, the process is stopped and that value is returned by waitForMessageCondition. |
|  options | { includeCurrent?: boolean; timeout?: number; } | <code>includeCurrent</code>: if true (the default), the <code>condition</code> function is first called for already received messages that are in [messages](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.messages.md)<!-- -->. Otherwise, it is only called on new messages, not yet received at the time <code>waitForMessageCondition</code> is called. <code>timeout</code>: the time in milliseconds to wait before the promise returned by <code>waitForMessageCondition</code> is rejected (if the condition does not return a truthy value during that time). Defaults to 10000ms (10s). |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;T&gt;
