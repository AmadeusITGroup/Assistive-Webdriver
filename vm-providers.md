## vm-providers package

This package contains functions to clone and start a virtual machine with one of the available providers (virtualbox or qemu), to send it keyboard and mouse events and finally to destroy it. It also contains some utilities commonly used with applications that need to control a virtual machine.

## Remarks

The main entry point to clone and start a virtual machine is the [createVM function](./vm-providers.createvm.md)

## Enumerations

|  Enumeration | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [Key](./vm-providers.key.md) | Keyboard keys that can be sent to a virtual machine through [VM.sendKeyDownEvent()](./vm-providers.vm.sendkeydownevent.md) and [VM.sendKeyUpEvent()](./vm-providers.vm.sendkeyupevent.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [MouseButton](./vm-providers.mousebutton.md) | Mouse buttons that can be sent to a virtual machine through [VM.sendMouseDownEvent()](./vm-providers.vm.sendmousedownevent.md) and [VM.sendMouseUpEvent()](./vm-providers.vm.sendmouseupevent.md)<!-- -->. |

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [findRectangle(image, color, expectedWidth, expectedHeight, colorTolerance)](./vm-providers.findrectangle.md) | Looks for a rectangle of the specified size, fully filled with the specified color, with the given color tolerance, in the given image. |
|  [getFreePort({ host })](./vm-providers.getfreeport.md) | Returns a free TCP port on the local IP address specified by the host parameter. |
|  [wait(delay)](./vm-providers.wait.md) | Waits for the specified delay. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [PortRedirection](./vm-providers.portredirection.md) | A port redirection from a port on the host to a port in the virtual machine. |
|  [QEMUSettings](./vm-providers.qemusettings.md) | Settings specifying how to create a virtual machine with the QEMU provider. |
|  [Rectangle](./vm-providers.rectangle.md) | Contains the position and size of a rectangle on the screen. |
|  [ScreenPosition](./vm-providers.screenposition.md) | A position in the screen, that extends [SimplePosition](./vm-providers.simpleposition.md) with the size of the screen in pixels, because it is needed by some providers (i.e. qemu) to compute the mouse position to send to the virtual machine. |
|  [SimplePosition](./vm-providers.simpleposition.md) | A position specified by the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) coordinates. |
|  [VirtualBoxSettings](./vm-providers.virtualboxsettings.md) | Settings specifying how to create a virtual machine with the VirtualBox provider. |
|  [VM](./vm-providers.vm.md) | This interface is implemented by each virtual machine provider. It specifies the set of operations that can be done on a virtual machine, including sending keyboard and mouse events and destroying the virtual machine. |
|  [VMConfig](./vm-providers.vmconfig.md) | Configuration that can be passed to [createVM](./vm-providers.createvm.md) when cloning and starting a virtual machine. |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [createSubLogFunction](./vm-providers.createsublogfunction.md) | Creates a log function that, whenever it is called, calls the log function passed as the first paremeter with the predefined properties passed as the second parameter, (in addition to the properties it received it is called with). |
|  [createVM](./vm-providers.createvm.md) | Clone and start a virtual machine, using the provider specified in the <code>type</code> property of [VMSettings](./vm-providers.vmsettings.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [isShiftedKey](./vm-providers.isshiftedkey.md) | Returns whether it is necessary to have the <code>Shift</code> key pressed to type the given character (with the US keyboard layout). |
|  [keysMap](./vm-providers.keysmap.md) | Map of keyboard keys. The key in the map is a character produced by the key (either with or without pressing <code>Shift</code>). The value in the map is the key from the [Key](./vm-providers.key.md) enum. |
|  [logMessages](./vm-providers.logmessages.md) | Map of all messages that can be logged from this package. The key in the map is in the format: <code>category</code>.<code>message</code>, with <code>category</code> and <code>message</code> the properties from the log entry object passed to the [LogFunction](./vm-providers.logfunction.md)<!-- -->. The value in the map is the log message in English. |
|  [vmFactories](./vm-providers.vmfactories.md) | Map of available virtual machine providers. The key in the map corresponds to the <code>type</code> property in [VMSettings](./vm-providers.vmsettings.md)<!-- -->. The value is the [VMFactory](./vm-providers.vmfactory.md) implemented by the provider. |

## Type Aliases

|  Type Alias | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [LogFunction](./vm-providers.logfunction.md) | A log function, as expected by this package. |
|  [VMFactory](./vm-providers.vmfactory.md) | The virtual machine factory provided by each virtual machine provider. It is a function that takes the configuration and asynchronously returns an object that implements the [VM](./vm-providers.vm.md) interface. |
|  [VMSettings](./vm-providers.vmsettings.md) | Settings specifying how to create a virtual machine. Depending on the chosen provider (determined by the type property), the required settings are different. |
