## ScreenReaderClient.waitForMessage() method

Waits for a specific message from the screen reader.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
waitForMessage(expectedText: ExpectedText, options?: {
        clean?: boolean;
        includeCurrent?: boolean;
        timeout?: number;
    }): Promise<string[]>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  expectedText | [ExpectedText](./assistive-playwright-client.expectedtext.md) | expectation about the message to receive |
|  options | { clean?: boolean; includeCurrent?: boolean; timeout?: number; } | <code>clean</code>: if true (the default), once the expected message is found, all messages up to (and including) the expected message are removed from the [messages](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.messages.md) array. <code>includeCurrent</code>: if true (the default), the expected message is also searched for in the already received messages (in the current [messages](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.messages.md) array). Otherwise, it is only searched for in the future messages. <code>timeout</code>: the time in milliseconds to wait before the promise returned by <code>waitForMessage</code> is rejected (if the expected message is not found during that time). Defaults to 10000ms (10s). |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;string\[\]&gt;

The array of messages up to (and including) the message matching the expectations.
