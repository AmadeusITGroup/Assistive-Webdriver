## VirtualBoxSettings.server property

Specifies the address at which the vboxwebsrv command is exposing the virtualbox API. Note that connecting to a different machine is not currently supported (because of port redirections that are expected to be available on the local machine), so this option is mostly useful to change the port that vboxwebsrv is listening to.
