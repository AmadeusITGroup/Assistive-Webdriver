## VMKeyboard.insertText() method

An alias of [VMKeyboard.type()](./assistive-playwright-client.vmkeyboard.type.md)<!-- -->. In playwright, [insertText](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-keyboard#keyboardinserttexttext) differs from [type](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-keyboard#keyboardtypetext-options) by the fact that `insertText` only dispatches an `input` event and no `keydown`<!-- -->, `keyup` or `keypress` event. Here, as the goal is to use only low-level events, there is no distinction between `insertText` and `type`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
insertText(text: string): Promise<void>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  text | string |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;
