## ExpectedText type

Type of an expectation from a message coming from the screen reader.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type ExpectedText = ExpectedText[] | string | RegExp | ((text: string) => boolean);
```
<b>References:</b> [ExpectedText](./assistive-playwright-client.expectedtext.md)

## Remarks

[isMatch()](./assistive-playwright-client.ismatch.md) can be used to check whether a specific message `screenReaderText` from the screen reader matches an expectation `expectedText` and [ScreenReaderClient.waitForMessage()](./assistive-playwright-client.screenreaderclient.waitformessage.md) can be used to wait for a message from the screen reader that matches the expectation `expectedText`<!-- -->.

`expectedText` can be:

- a string: the text matches if `screenReaderText` contains the text in `expectedText`

- a regular expression: the text matches if `screenReaderText` matches the regular expression

- a function: the function is called, and should return a boolean describing whether it matches or not.

- an array: the text matches if there is a match with one of the items of the array (which can be a string, a regular expression, a function or a nested array), according to the rules previously mentioned
