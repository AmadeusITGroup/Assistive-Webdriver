## Properties

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [down(key)](./assistive-playwright-client.vmkeyboard.down.md) |  | Sends a low-level keydown event to the virtual machine. |
|  [insertText(text)](./assistive-playwright-client.vmkeyboard.inserttext.md) |  | An alias of [VMKeyboard.type()](./assistive-playwright-client.vmkeyboard.type.md)<!-- -->. In playwright, [insertText](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-keyboard#keyboardinserttexttext) differs from [type](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-keyboard#keyboardtypetext-options) by the fact that <code>insertText</code> only dispatches an <code>input</code> event and no <code>keydown</code>, <code>keyup</code> or <code>keypress</code> event. Here, as the goal is to use only low-level events, there is no distinction between <code>insertText</code> and <code>type</code>. |
|  [press(key, options)](./assistive-playwright-client.vmkeyboard.press.md) |  | Shortcut for [VMKeyboard.down()](./assistive-playwright-client.vmkeyboard.down.md) and [VMKeyboard.up()](./assistive-playwright-client.vmkeyboard.up.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [type(text, options)](./assistive-playwright-client.vmkeyboard.type.md) |  | Sends a low-level keydown and keyup event for each character in the text. |
|  [up(key)](./assistive-playwright-client.vmkeyboard.up.md) |  | Sends a low-level keyup event to the virtual machine. |
